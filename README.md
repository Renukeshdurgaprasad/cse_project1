# Basic Atm interface(MY FIRST PROJECT)
 our team of three members done a small project  to show the basic operations(like withdraw,deposit and shows the bank balance ) by using programming language java . 
we used concepts of java like inheritanace ,interfaces,packages ,method chaining ,string tokinezer concepts and files concept . 
we used classes to store the data about the customer  like customer name,password,how much amount in the account . 
we used files concepts to if there is any change like if we deposite the money want to increment,even if start executing again it will comes continue because of files concept . 
we used packages to divide the project into different modules . 
String tokenizer is used to divide the data which was extracted from the files . 
we add a feature to generate otp and for that we used random method which import from java libraries and that otp was stored in a file ,if we enter the otp correctly then only it will moves to futhure steps like withdraw ,deposite ,etc. It will gives three chances to enter the otp correctly if it is wrong you unable to get the details of the account for some time.
and concepts like inheritance and interfaces are used to implement some basic activities.
