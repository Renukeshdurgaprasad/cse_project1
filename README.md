# Basic Atm interface
 our team of three members done a small project  to show the basic operations(like withdraw,deposit and shows the bank balance ) by using programming language java.
we used concepts of java like inheritanace ,interfaces,packages ,method chaining and files concept.
we used classes to store the data about the customer  like customer name,password,how much amount in the account.
we used files concepts to if there is any change like if we deposite the money want to increment,even if start executing again it will comes continue because of files concept.
we used packages to divide the project into different modules.
and concepts like inheritance and interfaces are used to implement some basic activities.
